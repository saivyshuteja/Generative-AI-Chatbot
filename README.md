# Generative-AI-Chatbot

Technical Stack: Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Ollama, OpenAI, Langsmith

Key Features & Contributions:

Developed an end-to-end question-answering chatbot using generative AI models, achieving dynamic response generation through a streamlined pipeline.

Integrated LangChain components (ChatPromptTemplate, StrOutputParser) with Ollama's open-source LLMs (like LLaMA 3.1) for flexible model deployment.

Designed an interactive UI using Streamlit, enabling users to: Select AI models via sidebar dropdown Adjust response creativity (temperature: 0.0–1.0) and length (50–300 tokens) Input natural language queries through chat interface

Implemented Langsmith tracing for monitoring AI interactions and debugging. Configured environment variables for secure API key management using Python-dotenv.

Impact: Enhanced accessibility of LLM technology through a user-friendly interface while maintaining architectural flexibility for model switching and parameter tuning.

This project demonstrates full-stack AI application development skills, from backend integration of ML frameworks to frontend UI design for AI systems.
